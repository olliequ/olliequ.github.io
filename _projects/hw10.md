# IS445: Homework #10
## This was completed by Oliver Quarm and Dilan Patel

Our notebook is [here](https://github.com/olliequ/olliequ.github.io/blob/main/python_notebooks/hw10.ipynb). Alternatively, you can access it using the `The Analysis` button in the bottom right.

Below is an embedded version of the interactive chart we have created. This was done by saving the chart in the Jupter Notebook as a JSON file in the `assets` folder.

Because the second visualization is quite wide, you may need to scroll to the right to fully see it depending on the size of your screen/monitor.
