# A deep-dive into data surround the Olympic Games! 
## This was completed by Oliver Quarm (NetID: oquarm2, Group 10) for IS445's Final Project

## Introduction
For the final project I analysed extensive data for the Olympic Games, spanning over a century! My primary dataset was a massive CSV of individual entries of athletes, including their age, height, weight, but more importantly their nation, event, and any medals won. Below is my main visualization (it's interactive!) for this dataset:

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/json/main_dashboard.json" style="width: 100%"></vegachart>

My notebook is [here](https://github.com/olliequ/olliequ.github.io/blob/main/python_notebooks/hw10.ipynb). Alternatively, you can access it using the `The Analysis` button in the bottom right.

Below is an embedded version of the interactive chart we have created. This was done by saving the chart in the Jupter Notebook as a JSON file in the `assets` folder.

For the contextual dataset, I looked at more high-level, wholistic data for each Olympic Games host nation. I made 2 visualizations: 1 was the spending amount for various host nations, and the second was the number of events various host nations had for their Olympic Games. These 2 are displayed below:
